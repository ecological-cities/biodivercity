Using area QT (Queenstown) example, sampling points can randomly generated. Subset example data area, focusing survey period 2. Next, within area interest, generate sampling points specified density buffer radius using function random_pt_gen(). case, specify one point per 50 hectares (500000 m2), radius 50 m point. radius value minimum distance generated points boundaries—ensures region animal surveys extend beyond boundaries Queenstown. excess sampling points can generated, case points unsuitable surveys (e.g. within areas inaccessible surveyors); instance, based specified parameters, 1.5 times required number points can generated. Finally, sub-areas interest (queenstown_forest) can also specified; sampling points stratified areas within outside queenstown_forest (.e. ‘Forest’ ‘Urban’ land cover types, respectively): output points sf object (POINT geometry) containing unique identifier, type (‘Normal’ ‘Sub-area’) geographical coordinates point: Visualise generated points within queenstown:","code":"data(sampling_areas) data(sampling_forests) head(sampling_areas) ## Simple feature collection with 6 features and 1 field ## Geometry type: POLYGON ## Dimension:     XY ## Bounding box:  xmin: 353618.5 ymin: 141963.4 xmax: 384748.9 ymax: 161017.8 ## Projected CRS: WGS 84 / UTM zone 48N ##   area                       geometry ## 1   BS POLYGON ((371976.9 150656, ... ## 2   JW POLYGON ((358502.3 149045, ... ## 3   PG POLYGON ((379073.3 156986.3... ## 4   QT POLYGON ((365379.3 145134.7... ## 5   TP POLYGON ((384558.6 150112.5... ## 6   WL POLYGON ((363419.4 160258.2... head(sampling_forests) ## Simple feature collection with 6 features and 2 fields ## Geometry type: POLYGON ## Dimension:     XY ## Bounding box:  xmin: 364789.6 ymin: 141985.4 xmax: 366695.6 ymax: 145712.4 ## Projected CRS: WGS 84 / UTM zone 48N ##   area period                       geometry ## 1   QT      1 POLYGON ((364789.6 145712.4... ## 2   QT      1 POLYGON ((365541.3 144630.1... ## 3   QT      1 POLYGON ((365538.2 144603.3... ## 4   QT      1 POLYGON ((365992 142465.8, ... ## 5   QT      1 POLYGON ((365472.9 143750.2... ## 6   QT      1 POLYGON ((365615.5 143720.4... queenstown <- sampling_areas[sampling_areas$area %in% \"QT\", ] queenstown_forest <- sampling_forests[sampling_forests$area == \"QT\" & sampling_forests$period == 2,] set.seed(123)  points <- random_pt_gen(boundaries = queenstown,                         area_per_pt = 500000,                         pt_radius = 50,                         excess_modifier = 1.5,                         sub_areas = queenstown_forest) ##  ##  Total number of points required: 13. ##  ##  Number of points required within 'normal' areas: 12. ##  Number of points required within 'sub-areas': 1. ##  ##  Number of points within 'normal' areas that were generated: 18 (n = 12, excess_modifier = 1.5). ##  Number of points within 'sub-areas' that were generated: 2 (n = 1, excess_modifier = 1.5). head(points) ## Simple feature collection with 6 features and 2 fields ## Geometry type: POINT ## Dimension:     XY ## Bounding box:  xmin: 364719 ymin: 142645.6 xmax: 367118.5 ymax: 143706.5 ## Projected CRS: WGS 84 / UTM zone 48N ##     type      id                         x ## 1 Normal normal1   POINT (366618 142645.6) ## 2 Normal normal2 POINT (366155.9 142805.7) ## 3 Normal normal3 POINT (365832.6 143706.5) ## 4 Normal normal4 POINT (367118.5 142757.4) ## 5 Normal normal5   POINT (364719 143528.1) ## 6 Normal normal6 POINT (366407.7 142761.1) ggplot(data = queenstown) +   geom_sf(fill = NA) +   theme_void() +   geom_sf(data = queenstown_forest, fill = \"darkgreen\") +   geom_sf(data = points, aes(col = type),           show.legend = \"point\")"},{"path":"https://ecological-cities.github.io/biodivercity/articles/more/animals-survey-protocols.html","id":"generate-sampling-points---retained","dir":"Articles > More","previous_headings":"Pre-survey preparations","what":"Generate sampling points - Retained","title":"Animals: Survey Protocols","text":"surveys conducted across multiple periods (e.g. years), may need retain sampling points previous period, example, long-term monitoring location. case, new points can generated ensuring certain proportion points similar previous period.
