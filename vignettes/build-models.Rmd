This article outlines a workflow to build predictive models of diversity for a chosen animal group. Fauna and landscape data should have already been prepared based on `vignette("process-animal")` and `vignette("process-landscape")`, respectively. Based on community ecology theory, we ‘decompose’ animal diversity into two components: (1) local (_Alpha_) diversity and (2) community (_Beta_) diversity. A predictive model will be built for each component.

In the examples below, generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) are used, since linear models are generally simpler and provide better interpretability. Do note that other types of models/algorithms may also be used instead. Also, the full list of potential predictor variables may first be narrowed down; for example, random forest models may be used to select variables based on their relative importance in improving model performance (Arthur et al., 2010; Li et al., 2017).

## 1. Local (_Alpha_) diversity

For a chosen animal group, local (_Alpha_) diversity is represented by the number of species recorded at sampling point locations (i.e., species density). The response variable specified within the GLMM is the number (count) of species.

First, load the necessary packages:

```{r load required libraries, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library("biodivercity")
library("tidyverse") # to process/wrangle data
library("sf") # to process landscape data
library("tmap") # spatial visualisation

library("lme4") # mixed-effects modelling
library("MuMIn") # model selection & averaging
```

```{r load biodivercity while in dev, include = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
library("tidyverse") 
library("sf") 
library("tmap")

library("lme4")
library("MuMIn")
```

Load the example datasets for birds (animal group 'Aves') recorded at sampling points across Singapore. `birds` is a dataframe containing the number of species aggregated across multiple surveys (i.e., species richness; column '`sprich`'), and `landscape` is a dataframe containing landscape predictors summarised within specified buffer radii. See `data(animal_surveys)` and `data(points_landscape)` for more details on the animal and landscape data, respectively.

```{r load example data}
filepath <- system.file("extdata", "build-models_alpha-diversity.Rdata", package="biodivercity")
load(filepath)
```

Pivot the `landscape_data` to wide format, with the prefix `r<radius>m_` (representing the radius size) appended to the column names of predictors:

```{r transform and combine data, message = FALSE}
landscape <- landscape %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(starts_with("osm_"), starts_with("lsm_")),
               names_to = 'metric') %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c("town", "point_id"),
              names_from = c("radius_m", "metric"), 
              values_from = "value",
              names_glue = "r{radius_m}m_{metric}")

# combine bird and landscape data, then then scale/center variables
birds <- birds %>% 
  inner_join(landscape, by = c("town", "point_id")) 
birds_scaled <- birds %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = where(is.numeric) & !sprich, scale))

head(birds_scaled) # view combined data
```

To fit the model as a GLMM, the function `MuMIn::dredge()` will be used. The function includes customisation options; for instance, the `subset` argument allows the user to exclude certain combinations of variables within the fitted model (i.e., apply constraints to possible models that may be built). In the following example, we do not allow the same landscape predictor summarised within multiple buffer radii to be present in the same model.

```{r create object to be supplied to function argument}

predictors <- grep("^r[0-9]+m_",  colnames(birds_scaled), value = TRUE) # get predictor names

# get rows with same predictors but different radii
var_comb <- combn(predictors, 2) %>% # unique combinations
  t() %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>%  # separate radii & predictors
  separate(V1, c("V1_radius", "V1_predictor"),
           sep = "(?<=[0-9])m_(?=[A-Za-z]*)", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  separate(V2, c("V2_radius", "V2_predictor"),
           sep = "(?<=[0-9])m_(?=[A-Za-z]*)", remove = FALSE) %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(similar = grepl(V1_predictor, V2_predictor)) %>% 
  filter(isTRUE(similar))

# create object to be supplied to function argument
subset_vect <- paste(var_comb$V1, "&", var_comb$V2)
subset_exp <- parse(text = paste0("!(", paste(subset_vect, collapse = ") & !("), ")")) # function argument requires an expression

```

```{r include = FALSE}
rm(filepath, landscape,
   var_comb, subset_vect)
```

Next, we fit both a global (maximal) model and null model, in order to calculate the difference in Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value within the function `MuMIn::dredge()`. In the example data, the '`town`' is specified as the random effect. The argument '`family`' is specified as `"poisson"`, since the response variable is count data. See the function `lme4::glmer()` for more details and information on its arguments.

```{r global and null model}
model_global <- 
  glmer(paste("sprich", "~", paste(predictors, collapse = " + "), 
              "+ (1|town) "),
        family = "poisson",
        na.action = "na.fail",
        control = lme4::glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa"),
        data = birds_scaled)

model_null <- 
  glmer(sprich ~ 1 + (1|town), family = "poisson", data = birds_scaled)
```

Automated model selection is performed using the function `MuMIn::dredge()`. Models are ranked based on their `AICc` value (AIC adjusted for small sample sizes). Model constraints are specified in the argument `subset`. To avoid a long runtime in this demonstration, we also limit the number of predictor variables in each model to four (argument `m.lim`).

```{r example dredge - dredge, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
model_glm <- dredge(model_global,
                    subset= subset_exp,
                    m.lim=c(NA,4), # max of 4 variables
                    rank="AICc")
```

The resulting object contains a model selection table, with each row representing a model that was fit. It is arranged in ascending order, based on AIC value (lower AIC value represents a 'better' model). A summary of the top models with values of ΔAIC < 2 can be viewed:

```{r table of best models}
bestmodels_info <- subset(model_glm, 
                         delta < 2, 
                         recalc.weights=FALSE)

knitr::kable(bestmodels_info, caption = "**Summary of best models ranked based on automated model selection from `MuMIn::dredge()` (ΔAIC < 2).**") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling("striped") %>% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "300px")
```
We can also visualise the importance (based on sum-of-weights) and effect direction (based on coefficient value) for each variable within the top models:

```{r plot important variables, message = FALSE, dpi = 300, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}

# average the effect of each predictor
effects <- data.frame(coef(bestmodels_info)[,-1]) %>% 
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "var") %>% 
  mutate(effect = ifelse(value > 0, "Positive", "Negative"))

# get importance of each predictor
importances <- data.frame(MuMIn::sw(bestmodels_info)) %>% 
  rename(imp = MuMIn..sw.bestmodels_info.) %>% 
  rownames_to_column("var") %>% 
  left_join(effects, by = "var") %>% # join with effects
  mutate(effect = ifelse(is.na(effect), "Mixed (factor)", effect)) %>%
  mutate(effect = factor(effect, levels = c("Positive", "Negative", "Mixed (factor)")))

# plot
ggplot(data=importances, aes(x = imp, y = reorder(var, imp), 
                     fill = effect)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Sum of weights", y = "Variables") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#4daf4a", "#e41a1c", "#377eb8"),
                    name = "Effect")

```

Finally, we can extract the models and `recipes::recipe()` objects for future use:

```{r}

# get list of best models
bestmodels <- MuMIn::get.models(bestmodels_info, subset = TRUE)

# create recipes object only with predictors within best models
predictors_best <- colnames(coef(bestmodels_info)[,-1])

birds <- birds %>% # original unscaled dataset
  dplyr::select(sprich, town, all_of(predictors_best)) # remove unnecessary columns

recipe_birds <- recipes::recipe(birds) %>% 
  recipes::update_role(sprich, new_role = "outcome") %>%
  recipes::update_role(town, new_role = "id") %>%
  recipes::update_role_requirements("id", bake = FALSE) %>%
  recipes::step_normalize(all_of(predictors_best)) %>% 
  recipes::prep()
```


```{r, include = FALSE}
rm(birds, birds_scaled, predictors, subset_exp,
   model_glm, model_global, model_null, 
   effects, importances,
   bestmodels, bestmodels_info, predictors_best, recipe_birds)
```

## 2. Community (_Beta_) diversity

Variable selection can first be done prior to building the models for beta diversity. For example, random forest can be performed using the packages `randomForestSRC` and `MultivariateRandomForest`.

Next, partial regularised discriminant analysis (RDA) models may be used to model the relationship between animal communities and landscape predictors, while considering the inherent spatial structure of the animal communities. The landscape predictors will be summarised as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) axes, and the spatial variation quantified using Principle Coordinates of Neighbourhood Matrices (PCNM).

First, load the additional package `vegan`:

```{r load vegan, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library("vegan")
```

As before, bird and landscape data at sampling points across six areas (towns) in Singapore will be used in this example. The example dataset, `birds`, contains both animal and landscape datasets processed in the previous two articles. The variable selection output using random forest is also loaded as `landscape`.

```{r load data, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

filepath <- system.file("extdata", "build-models_beta-diversity.Rdata", package="biodivercity")
load(filepath)

data("sampling_points")

```

Add the coordinate information for PCNM analysis.

```{r appending spatial information to landscape dataset, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
birds <- birds %>%
  mutate(Y = {(sampling_points$geometry[match(birds$point_id,sampling_points$point_id)] %>% 
                 sf::st_coordinates())[,1]},
         .after = point_id) %>%
  mutate(X = {(sampling_points$geometry[match(birds$point_id,sampling_points$point_id)] %>% 
                 sf::st_coordinates())[,2]}, 
         .after = point_id)
```

Using the variables selected by random forest, we can now perform the principal component analysis (PCA) to summarise the landscape predictors. Retain only PCA axes with eigenvalues greater than one, to select for PCA axes that account for more variance than the original variables on their own.

```{r diagnosis by PCA}
pca_birds <- birds %>% 
  dplyr::select(any_of(landscape$var)) %>% # select impt variables from random forest output
  prcomp(.,scale.=TRUE) # conduct pca

pca_selected_birds <- pca_birds$x[, which(pca_birds$sdev > 1)]
```

Calculate the PCNM vectors using `vegan::pcnm()` and fit the animal community matrix against these PCNM vectors using `vegan::rda()`. To control for type I error while testing for significant predictors, significant PCNM vectors can first be selected using a backwards, stepwise elimination method until all vectors have a significance level smaller than the chosen significance level of 0.05 (Peres-Neto & Legendre, 2010). This can be performed using `vegan::ordistep()`.

```{r PCNM, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
plots.xy <- cbind(birds$X, birds$Y)
raw_pcnm_birds <- pcnm(dist(plots.xy))

pcnm_scores_birds <-data.frame(scores(raw_pcnm_birds))

set.seed(123)

birds.pcnm.all <- rda(bird_com~., data = pcnm_scores_birds)
birds.pcnm.sub <- ordistep(birds.pcnm.all, direction = "backward", pout = 0.075)

```

Perform partial RDA with the selected PCA axes as candidate explanatory variables and the significant PCNM vectors as covariates. Perform `vegan::ordistep()` to select for the significant PCA axes while accounting for the effects of the covariables in the model, until all PCA axes have significance level smaller than the chosen significance level of 0.05.

```{r stepwise selection with env vars, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
birds_selected <- cbind(pca_selected_birds, pcnm_scores_birds)

birds.rda.all <- update(birds.pcnm.sub, 
                        paste0("~. +", {paste((colnames(pca_selected_birds)), collapse=" +")}), # add selected PCA
                        data = birds_selected)

birds.rda.sub <- ordistep(birds.rda.all, direction = "backward") # assess p-value for dropping variables

```

The final RDA model is fitted with the significant PC axes and PCNM vectors.

```{r examine rda results and fit final model, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
birds.rda.sub$call

birds.rda.fin <- rda(bird_com ~ PC1 + PC3 + Condition(PCNM1 + PCNM2 + PCNM3 + PCNM4 + PCNM5 + PCNM25), data = birds_selected)
```

Calculate the average probability of each species occurring across all points. 

```{r p-hats}
p_hats_birds <- apply(bird_com, 2, mean)
```

These are the required objects to use the predictive _Beta_-diversity model in the future:

1. pca_birds
2. raw_pcnm_birds
3. birds.rda.fin
4. p_hats_birds

```{r save beta model objs, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
save(pca_birds,
     raw_pcnm_birds,
     birds.rda.fin, 
     p_hats_birds,
     file = "./your/working/directory/beta_model_birds.Rdata")
```
