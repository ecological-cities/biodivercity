This article details various ways to download and process publicly available landscape data to build predictive models of animal diversity. Here, landscape data refers to data derived from both open-source maps and freely-available satellite data. The following outline includes methods to download, process and summarise the landscape data for a specified date range and spatial areas.

First, load the necessary packages to run the analysis:

```{r load required libraries, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library("biodivercity")
library("dplyr") # to process/wrangle data
library("sf") # to process vector data
library("tmap") # for visualisation
```

```{r load biodivercity while in dev, include = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
library("sf")
library("dplyr")
library("tmap")
```

The Punggol (`PG`) area (town) in Singapore from the example data `sampling_areas` will be used to demonstrate the steps in this article, shown in the interactive map below.

```{r plot punggol area, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 1.0, dpi = 300, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}

data(sampling_areas)

sampling_areas <- sampling_areas %>%
   filter(area == "PG")

tmap_mode("view")
tm_basemap(c("CartoDB.Positron")) +
  tm_shape(sampling_areas) + tm_borders(lwd = 2.0)
```
<br>

Finally, since this analysis involves the downloading of datasets, define an output directory for raw and processed data to be exported to:

```{r define output directories, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
output_dir <- "</FILEPATH/TO/DIRECTORY>"
```

<br>

## OpenStreetMap (OSM) data

Built elements of the landscape can be retrieved from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database. Building polygons and road lines will be extracted from `sampling_areas` using the functions `get_buildings_osm()` and `get_roads_osm()` respectively. The `date` argument, if specified, must be a snapshot date present within the [Geofabrik database](https://download.geofabrik.de). If not, the latest data will be downloaded. In this example, we download these urban elements for the date 1 Jan 2021 and visualise them below:

```{r download urban elements, eval = FALSE}

dir.create(paste0(output_dir, "/osm")) # create sub-directory for raw data

buildings <- get_buildings_osm(place = sampling_areas,
                               date = as.Date("2021-01-01"),
                               dir_raw = paste0(output_dir, "/osm"))

roads <- get_roads_osm(sampling_areas,
                       date = as.Date("2021-01-01"),
                       dir_raw = paste0(output_dir, "/osm"))

tmap_mode("view")
tm_basemap(c("CartoDB.Positron")) +
  tm_shape(sampling_areas) + tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(buildings) + tm_polygons(col = "levels") +
  tm_shape(roads) + tm_lines(col = "lanes", palette = "YlOrRd")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width=2.6, fig.height = 2.0, dpi = 300, out.width="100%"}

filepath <- system.file("extdata", "osm_data.Rdata", package = "biodivercity")
load(filepath)

tmap_mode("view")
tm_basemap(c("CartoDB.Positron")) +
  tm_shape(sampling_areas) + tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(buildings) + tm_polygons(col = "levels") +
  tm_shape(roads) + tm_lines(col = "lanes", palette = "YlOrRd")
```

<br>

### Summarise OSM metrics

We can summarise various metrics for the downloaded datasets, at specific point locations and buffer radii. In this example, we randomly generate three points within the `sampling_areas`.

```{r}
set.seed(123)

points <- st_sample(sampling_areas, 3) %>% 
  st_as_sf() %>% 
  mutate(point_id = row.names(.)) # unique identifier
```

The following lists the possible metrics that may be summarised from the downloaded OSM data:

- Buildings (polygons) each with the number of levels
    - Floor area ratio (`buildingFA_ratio`)    
    - Average number of levels (`buildingAvgLvl`)

- Roads (lines) each with the number of lanes 
    - Lane density (`laneDensity`)
    
<br>

The function `osm_perpoint_specified()` can be be used to generate the summaries. To do so, we need to supply a character vector of predictor names to the function argument `predictors_osm`. The naming format is `r<value>m_osm_<metric>`; the prefix `r<value>m` denotes the buffer radius that the particular landscape data was summarised within, and `_osm_` denotes that the variables are based on OpenStreetMap data. For example, we can summarise the building floor area ratio at a radius of 50 m and 100 m around `points`–these variables are appended as new columns.

```{r osm_perpoint, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# variables to summarise
predictors <- c("r50m_osm_buildingFA_ratio", "r100m_osm_buildingFA_ratio") 

points <- osm_perpoint_specified(vector_osm = buildings,
                                 building_levels = "levels",
                                 predictors_osm = predictors,
                                 points = points) 

points
```

## Sentinel-2 satellite data

Land cover information can be derived from publicly available Sentinel-2 data, downloadable via the package [`sen2r`](http://sen2r.ranghetti.info/index.html). Numerous parameters can be defined, both programmatically and via a graphical user interface as follows. It also allows us to run pre-processing steps such as cloud masking, atmospheric correction and the calculation of spectral indices. Refer to the website for more information on its [installation and use](http://sen2r.ranghetti.info/articles/installation.html).

```{r sen2r gui, eval = FALSE}
library(sen2r)
sen2r()
```


```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', dpi = 300, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "**Figure: A screenshot of the `sen2r` graphical user interface accessible by running `sen2r::sen2r()`.**"}
knitr::include_graphics("sen2r-gui.png", dpi = 300)
```

<br>

The same parameters can be specified as arguments within `sen2r()`, or loaded from a JSON file. In this example, we download data from 1 Jan to 30 Jun 2021, with not more than 15% cloud cover within `sampling_areas`. For each image, the spectral indices [`NDVI`](https://www.indexdatabase.de/db/i-single.php?id=58) and [`NDWI2`](https://www.indexdatabase.de/db/i-single.php?id=546) will also be processed; these will be used to map vegetation and water cover, respectively. Do note that you will need to enter your account credentials with the [ESA Sentinel Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home). Detailed steps and the use of other servers (e.g. Google Cloud) can be found on the [package website](http://sen2r.ranghetti.info/index.html).

```{r sen2r, eval = FALSE}

# create sub-directories
dir.create(paste0(output_dir, "/sen2r")) 
dir.create(paste0(output_dir, "/sen2r/raw"))

out_paths <- sen2r(
  param_list = sen2r_params,
  timewindow = as.Date(c("2021-01-01", "2021-06-30")),
  max_cloud_safe = 15, # max 15% cloud cover in raw tile
  max_mask = 15, # max 15% cloud cover over sampling_areas
  extent = geojsonsf::sf_geojson(sampling_areas) # needs geojson as input
  extent_as_mask = TRUE, # pixel values outside are set to NA
  clip_on_extent = TRUE,
  list_indices = c("NDVI", "NDWI2") # to map vegetation and water
  list_rgb = "RGB432B", # output an RGB image as well
  path_l2a = paste0(output_dir, "/sen2r/raw"), 
  path_l1c = paste0(output_dir, "/sen2r/raw"),
  path_out = paste0(output_dir, "/sen2r"),
  path_indices = paste0(output_dir, "/sen2r"))
```

<br>

For each data type (e.g. spectral index), we can combine all raster images captured within the specified date range by averaging the pixel values across files, thus forming an image mosaic. This allows us to avoid relying on any one image for our analysis, and to deal with missing data (e.g. due to high cloud cover) during the period of interest. The function `mosaic_sen2r()` creates the mosaic by averaging the pixel values across the multiple rasters. It is a convenience function that processes the images based on the output folder structure of `sen2r()`; ensure that the function argument `parent_dir` in `mosaic_sen2r()` is similar to the function argument `path_out` in `sen2r()`.

```{r mosaic generation, eval = FALSE}
mosaic_sen2r(parent_dir = paste0(output_dir, "/sen2r"))
```

<br>

At this point, we have a single image mosaic (continuous raster) for each spectral index. While the continuous values from these rasters may be used directly in analyses, there may be instances were we want to work with discrete classes of land cover. One method is to separate pixels into one of two classes (e.g. vegetated or non-vegetated; water or non-water), based on an adaptively derived threshold value. For example, we can use Otsu's thresholding ([Otsu, 1979](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/_media/courses/a6m33bio/otsu.pdf)), which tends to outperform other techniques in terms of stability of results and processing speed, even with the presence of > 2 peaks in the histogram of pixel values ([Bouhennache et al., 2019](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10106049.2018.1497094)). This may be implemented using the function `threshold_otsu()`. As an example, let's load the NDVI raster for the Punggol area in Singapore for subsequent classification. The NDVI is a measure of healthy green vegetation, based on the tendency of plants to reflect NIR & absorb red light. It ranges from -1 (non-vegetated) to 1 (densely vegetated). The figure below shows the histogram of NDVI values in Punggol, as well as the adaptively derived threshold value (vertical line).

```{r}
ndvi_mosaic <- 
  system.file("extdata", "ndvi_mosaic.tif", package="biodivercity") %>% 
  terra::rast()

# get Otsu's threshold
threshold <- threshold_otsu(ndvi_mosaic)
threshold
```
```{r include = FALSE}
histogram <- terra::hist(ndvi_mosaic, breaks = 70, yaxt = 'n')
```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.width = 5, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, dpi = 300, out.width="70%", fig.cap="**Figure: Distribution of NDVI values across the Punggol area in Singapore, based on a mosaic of images collected from 2019-07-01 to 2021-06-30.**"}
plot(histogram, 
     xlab = "NDVI", xlim = c(-1, 1), main = "", yaxt = 'n',
      col = rgb(178/255,223/255,138/255, 0.5))
abline(v = threshold, col="black", lwd=2, lty = 2)
```

<br>

Note that the wrapper function `classify_image_binary()` directly classifies a continuous raster. It uses `threshold_otsu()` internally to define the threshold value. Run the function and visualise both the original NDVI and classified rasters (toggle the map layers to view each one separately).

```{r mosaic classification, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width=2.6, fig.height = 2.0, dpi = 300, out.width="100%"}
veg_classified <- classify_image_binary(ndvi_mosaic, threshold = "otsu")

tm_shape(ndvi_mosaic) +
  tm_raster(palette = c("Greens")) +
tm_shape(veg_classified) +
  tm_raster(style = "cat",
            palette = c("grey", "darkgreen"))
```

<br>

### Summarise landscape metrics

Landscape patterns (i.e., landscape metrics) can be quantified for each of land cover class within classified rasters, summarised at specific point locations and buffer radii. Landscape metrics can be calculated at various 'levels', or unit of analysis — _patch_, _class_, and _landscape_ (in order of widening spatial scale). Refer to the package [landscapemetrics](https://r-spatialecology.github.io/landscapemetrics/index.html) for more information.

```{r info on landscape metrics, echo = FALSE}

lsm <- landscapemetrics::list_lsm() %>%
  dplyr::select(-function_name) %>%
  filter(level != "patch") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "level", values_from = "name") %>%
  filter(metric != "ta", # remove unnecessary metrics
         #metric != "pr",
         #metric != "prd",
         metric != "rpr") %>% 
  mutate(name = coalesce(class, landscape)) %>% # new col for name
  relocate(name, .after = metric) %>%
  mutate(across(.cols = c("class", "landscape"), # simplify to Yes/NA 
                ~ifelse(is.na(.), NA, "Yes"))) %>%
  mutate(name = case_when( # add details to name
    grepl("_cv", metric) ~ paste(name, "(coef. of variation)"), 
    grepl("_mn", metric) ~ paste(name, "(mean)"),
    grepl("_sd", metric) ~ paste(name, "(st. dev.)"),
    TRUE ~ name
  )) %>%
  arrange(class, landscape, metric, type) %>%
  mutate(class = ifelse(is.na(class), "No", paste0("[", class, "](https://r-spatialecology.github.io/landscapemetrics/reference/lsm_c_", metric, ".html)"))) %>% 
  mutate(landscape = ifelse(is.na(landscape), "No", paste0("[", landscape, "](https://r-spatialecology.github.io/landscapemetrics/reference/lsm_l_", metric, ".html)"))) 


knitr::kable(lsm, format = "html", caption = "**Table: Examples of landscape metrics and their corresponding level(s) they may be calculated at (_class_/_landscape_)**. Details in hyperlinked text.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = T, position = "left")  %>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling("striped") %>% kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "600px")

rm(lsm)
```

<br>

Similar to the OSM data, we will use the `points` dataset, which were randomly generated within the `sampling_areas` earlier on. A wide variety of metrics may be summarised using the function `lsm_perpoint()`. The following example summarises all 'class-level' metrics for vegetation cover (`veg_classified`), at a buffer radii of 50 m and 100 m around `points`.

```{r lsm_perpoint, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
points <- lsm_perpoint(raster = veg_classified,
                                      points = points,
                                      buffer_sizes = c(50, 100), # in metres
                                      level = c("class"),
                                      class_names = c("veg"),
                                      class_values = c(1)) # pixel value of class
```

Alternatively, the function `lsm_perpoint_specified()` can be used to generate the metrics specified by their name. Similar to `osm_perpoint_specified()`, we need to supply a character vector of predictor names to the function argument `predictors_lsm`. The naming format is `r<value>m_osm_<metric>`; the prefix `r<value>m` denotes the buffer radius that the particular landscape data was summarised within, and `_lsm_` denotes that the variables are landscape metrics. For example, we can summarise the percentage of vegetated landscape (`pland` metric) at a radius of 100 m and 200 m around `points`–these variables are appended as new columns.

```{r lsm_perpoint_specified, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

predictors <- c("r100m_lsm_veg_pland", "r200m_lsm_veg_pland") # variables to summarise

points <- lsm_perpoint_specified(raster = veg_classified,
                                 predictors_lsm = predictors,
                                 class_names = c("veg"),
                                 class_values =  c(1),
                                 points = points)

points
```
