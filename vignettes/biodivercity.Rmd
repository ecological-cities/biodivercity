## Overview

Many frameworks to assess 'biodiversity' have been proposed in research and practice. Some offer a more holistic view, by including parts of the ecosystem (e.g., climate, soil, air, water, landscape structure, genetic variation) that may contribute to ‘total biodiversity’ within a given region. However, such conceptualisations of 'biodiversity' may include components with low causal proximity (e.g. indirect effect of the landscape on species diversity), and may be difficult to measure at wide spatial scales (e.g. genetic diversity, plant species diversity). In decision-making, unnecessary complexity may also risk contributing to mistrust or ignorance of the overall assessment. 

`biodivercity` is an R package for assessing the diversity of animal species in urban areas. It provides a way to directly assess the _habitat value_ of urban landscapes, based on their empirical effect on chosen animal groups (e.g., taxa such as birds, butterflies, odonates, amphibians, etc.). The key features include:

- Step-by-step protocols for random point sampling of an animal group within areas of interest
- Generate data summaries of the animals surveyed, at multiple levels of granularity (e.g., areas, periods, animal groups, species)
- Download and process landscape data within areas of interest (e.g., remotely sensed data, OpenStreetMap data, manually mapped data)
- Build predictive models to assess local (_Alpha_), community (_Beta_) and total (_Gamma_) diversity for an animal group
- Use models to make pixel-based spatial predictions across new areas and time periods
- Summarise predictions to benchmark and compare biodiversity 'performance' between planning units across the city

## Setup

Install the development version of `biodivercity` from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ecological-cities/biodivercity", ref = "main")
```

Load the package:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(biodivercity)
```

```{r include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::load_all() # to knit manually w latest changes (not built/installed yet)
# vignette will be checked in R-CMD check & package build (should use library(home2park))
```
