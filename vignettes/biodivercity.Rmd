## Overview

Multiple frameworks to assess urban biodiversity have been proposed in both research and practice. Some conceptualise 'biodiversity' to include genetic variation, landscape structure and other human-centric dimensions such as climate regulation and ecosystem functioning. While these offer a more comprehensive view of ‘total biodiversity’, certain components may have shortcomings in terms of their (1) causal proximity (e.g. indirect effect of the landscape on the diversity of other species); (2) measurability at-scale (e.g. genetic diversity, plant species diversity); and (3) precision (e.g. estimating water or thermal regulation by vegetation). In decision-making, unnecessary complexity may also risk contributing to mistrust or ignorance of the overall assessment. 

`biodivercity` is an R package for assessing the diversity of animal species in urban areas. It provides a way to directly assess the _habitat value_ of urban landscapes, based on their empirical effect on chosen animal groups (taxa). Examples for birds, butterflies, odonates and amphibians are provided. The key features include:

- Step-by-step protocols for random point sampling of an animal group within areas of interest.
- Generate data summaries of the animals surveyed at multiple levels (e.g. areas, periods, animal groups, species).
- Download and process landscape predictors within areas of interest (e.g. satellite imagery, OpenStreetMap data).
- Build and validate predictive models to assess local (alpha), community (beta) and total (gamma) diversity for an animal group.
- Convert vector data generated from future design scenarios into formats suitable for model predictions.
- Use models to make pixel-based spatial predictions across new areas, for both monitoring and future scenario planning purposes.
- Summarise predictions for city-wide scoring and benchmarking (i.e. allow comparisons to be made between zones used in city planning).

## Setup

Install the development version of `biodivercity` from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ecological-cities/biodivercity", ref = "main")
```

Load the package:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(biodivercity)
```

```{r include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::load_all() # to knit manually w latest changes (not built/installed yet)
# vignette will be checked in R-CMD check & package build (should use library(home2park))
```
