## Overview

By following this vignette, users will be able to predict (using a user-provided model object) animal species richness across a target landscape, and eventually visualise the prediction using a heatmap.

```{r load required libraries, eval = FALSE}
library("biodivercity")
library("tmap")
library("leaflet")
```

```{r load libraries while in dev, include = FALSE}
devtools::load_all() 

library("tmap")
library("leaflet")
```


## Spatial predictions

To make predictions across a large area, the target landscape is first broken up into many smaller points

`geom_to_grid` is used to overlay a grid (see Fig. 1 for example) over a target area where species richness predictions are desired. This function is a wrapper for the `st_make_grid` function with `what == "centers"`, from the package `sf`. The output is an object of class `sfc` that comprises points around which landscape variables are extracted within their respective distance buffers. Grid dimensions are variable and can be specified with `grid_dim`. `buffer_dist` is an optional argument for situations where landscape data is limited to the target area or smaller. The distance value for this argument should correspond to the largest buffer present in the variables, so as to not include areas with no landscape data.

```{r create grid for each UGS town, eval = FALSE}
# subset to regions where predictions can be made: >126m inwards from boundaries
bound_grid <- geom_to_grid(geom = bound,
                           buffer_dist = 126,
                           grid_dim = c(50, 50))
```

The `heatmap_raster` function is a combination of multiple functions that result in a final raster of species richness predictions for one taxon. A breakdown of the function is as follows:

1. Species richness is predicted at each point provided in the `geom` argument with the objects specified in `mods`, `env_df` and `landscape`.
2. A second grid is created using `st_make_grid` with `what == "polygons"` as a template for the final raster.
3. The grid template and prediction values are combined with `rasterize` from the `terra` package.

**Note**: Variables used in `landscape` should match variables in `env_df`.

```{r heatmap_raster, eval = FALSE}
# Minor edits to the env_df had to be made
# bird_env <- birds %>% 
#   dplyr::select(where(is.numeric) & !sprich) %>% 
#   dplyr::select(!r50m_man_GnPR) # non-GnPR dataset

bird_hm <- heatmap_raster(env_df = bird_env,
                          mods = birdmods,
                          landscape = grid_landscape,
                          geom = bound,
                          buffer_dist = 126,
                          grid_dim = c(50, 50),
                          name = "bird_hm") # optional
```

## Visualisation

```{r load data, include = FALSE}

                              package="biodivercity") %>% 
  terra::rast()

bird_heatmap_50m <- system.file("extdata", "bird_heatmap_50m.tif",
                              package="biodivercity") %>% 
  terra::rast()

bird_heatmap_20m <- system.file("extdata", "bird_heatmap_20m.tif",
                              package="biodivercity") %>% 
  terra::rast()
```
