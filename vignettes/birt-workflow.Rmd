## Overview

The project objectives are to:

This package facilitates existing analyses

### Sampling point generation
To determine sampling points, we first stratify land cover into two main classes of *natural vegetation* and *urban* land cover. These two mutually exclusive land cover types were then randomly sampled at a point density of one point per 50 hectares of land. 

The function `random_pt_gen` in this package can be used to read landcover shapefiles and randomly sample at a specified point density.
