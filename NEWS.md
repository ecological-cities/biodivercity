# biodivercity (development version)

- Build and use models to make spatial predictions for community (_Beta_) diversity
- Calculate and benchmark total (_Gamma_) diversity

<br>

# biodivercity 0.1.0

Key features include:

- Step-by-step protocols for random point sampling of an animal group within areas of interest
- Generate data summaries of the animals surveyed at multiple levels (e.g., areas, periods, animal groups, species)
- Download and process landscape predictors within areas of interest (e.g., remotely sensed data, OpenStreetMap data, manually generated data)
- Build predictive models to assess local (_Alpha_), community (_Beta_) and total (_Gamma_) diversity for an animal group (currently available only for _Alpha_ diversity)
- Use models to make pixel-based spatial predictions across new areas and time periods
- Convert vector data generated from future design scenarios into formats suitable for model predictions
- Summarise spatial predictions to benchmark and compare biodiversity 'performance' between planning units across the city
