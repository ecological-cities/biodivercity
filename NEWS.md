# biodivercity (development version)

- Use models to make pixel-based spatial predictions for community (_Beta_) diversity

<br>

# biodivercity 0.1.0

Key features include:

- Step-by-step protocols for random point sampling of an animal group within areas of interest
- Generate data summaries of the animals surveyed at multiple levels (e.g., areas, periods, animal groups, species)
- Download and process landscape predictors within areas of interest (e.g., remotely sensed data, OpenStreetMap data, manually generated data)
- Build predictive models to assess local (_Alpha_), community (_Beta_) and total (_Gamma_) diversity for an animal group
- Use models to make pixel-based spatial predictions across new areas and time periods (currently only available for _Alpha_ diversity)
