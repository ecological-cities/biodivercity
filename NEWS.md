# biodivercity (development version)

- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

#### Key features

- Step-by-step protocols for random point sampling of an animal group within areas of interest.
- Generate data summaries of the animals surveyed at multiple levels (e.g. areas, periods, animal groups, species).
- Download and process landscape predictors within areas of interest (e.g. satellite imagery, OpenStreetMap data).
- Build and validate predictive models to assess local (alpha), community (beta) and total (gamma) diversity for an animal group.
- Convert vector data generated from future design scenarios into formats suitable for model predictions.
- Use models to make pixel-based spatial predictions across new areas, for both monitoring and future scenario planning purposes.
- Summarise predictions for city-wide scoring and benchmarking (i.e. allow comparisons to be made between zones used in city planning).
